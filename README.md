# LogoDetection
Streamlit App using YOLOv11, RetinaNet, and DETR

This repository is a **Streamlit-based Computer Vision app** for detecting brand logos in images and videos using three different deep learning architectures:
- [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- [RetinaNet](https://github.com/fizyr/pytorch-retinanet)
- [DETR (Detection Transformer)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepLogo2)

The above three repositories are already cloned in the LogoDetection project folder in the gooogle drive link below.
